# Various stuff for university
Folders `akms-prX` are for the subject *System analysis and conceptual modelling*.
Each of them contains a `.puml` file, which is **PlantUML** code for the diagrams used in the task, a `README.md` file with description of the task (in russian), and a `prX-report` file with is basically the same readme but with a title page that relies on HTML (doesn't render correctly on Github).
The rendered diagrams and other stuff are in the `images` folder.
